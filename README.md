## ✨ Features

### Core

- **Create invoices** - Quick creation with form validation
- **Search & filter** - Instant search across all invoices
- **Status tracking** - Draft, Sent, Paid, Cancelled with visual indicators
- **PDF export** - Professional PDFs with full details
- **Dark mode** - for comfortable working
- **Duplicate invoices** - Copy existing invoices to use as templates

### Data Models

- **Contractors** - Contractor info (full name, abbreviation, bank details)
- **Companies** - Client/company data
- **Contracts** - Work agreements with hourly or fixed-rate settings

### Two Invoice Modes

1. **Hourly** - Rate × quantity with hours/days labels
2. **Fixed** - Fixed amount per milestone/phase

---

## 🔒 Snapshots & History

**Important:** When creating an invoice, Contractor, Company, and Contract data are saved as a
snapshot inside the Invoice.

This means:

- ✅ Old invoices can be regenerated to PDF even after Contractor/Company/Contract changes
- ✅ Actual data at the time of invoicing is always preserved
- ✅ No discrepancies between old and new invoices

**Sync:**
If you need to update an invoice with current Contractor/Company/Contract data - use the sync
button (updates the snapshot).

---

## 📋 PDF Template

Currently using one PDF template (see screenshot above).

**Customizable:**

- Almost all text in the template
- Field labels and names
- Multilingual support for date format (but always `YYYY MMM DD`)
